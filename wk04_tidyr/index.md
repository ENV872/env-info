## Assignment

### Data Wrangling Assignment (Individual)

1. Append the header `## 4. Tidying up Data` to your `env-info/students/<user>.Rmd` and include R chunks to run the demo and exercise in [**wk04_tidyr**](../wk04_tidyr.html). You'll find it easiest to copy and paste the demo portion from [`env-info/wk04_tidyr.Rmd`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucsb-bren/env-info/gh-pages/wk04_tidyr.Rmd) but will need to understand this material enough to apply the functions to the CO<sub>2</sub> dataset as R chunks and answer all the questions.

### Programing Assignment (Group)

1. Write a function in R to do some data analysis or simulation that your group will find interesting
    * include at least two different data types
    * return a list
    * include at least two different control structures
    * make sure you document your program
2. Add this function to your organization's github repository - Note this is how we will check to make sure you have completed the assignment - so make sure that your student listing has a link to your group's organization and that you have committed and pushed your function to that organization's respository
