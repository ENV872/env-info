```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Introduction

### Problem

TODO: include image example

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

### Solution

## Methods

### Data

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Results

### Figures

List of techniques to use:

- map of study area, using leaflet

- scatterplot of variables

### Tables
