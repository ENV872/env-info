## Content
        
I am interested in environmental remediation: pollution modeling and the data analysis that comes with that are my jam. I also think that the tools we are learning in this class are useful in the corporate setting -- performance metrics, etc. could all be run through tools like this.

## Techniques
        
Creating code that pushes graphs reflecting up-to-date datasets without doing more than clicking a button resonates deeply with me. Bring on the pretty graphs!
        
## Data
        
So far our group is only working with data samples given in RStudio, but as we evolve this quarter I'm excited to see what we dig up!
