## Check out this beautiful sea cucumber!

![Awesome Sea Cucumber](images/alxsmith_cucumber.png)

## Interest


- Tools for Stock Assessment and development of MSY models
- Supply Chain

## Content

We will have a very ~~awesome~~ **interesting** question very soon. 

## Techniques

All the techniques... *specifically*

- Parameteriztion
- Data Cleaning
- Modeling with feedback loops

## Data

Still deciding on which data to use. Below is sample data which includes:

* Fisherman indicator (fisherman=1)
* Age (yrs)
* Residence time (yrs)
* Height (cm)
* Weight (kg)
* Fish meals per week
* Parts of fish consumed:
   0=none, 1=mussle tissure, 2= sometimes whole fish, 3= whole fish
* Methyl Mercury (mg/g)
* Total Mercury (mg/g)

```{r}
#read csv

data = read.csv("data/alxsmith_fishermen.csv")


#output summary 
summary(data)
```

Here's a sample plot:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
fishfactor=factor(data$fishpart, levels = c(0,1,2,3), labels=c("No Fish", "Mussle Tissue", "Whole Fish\n(sometimes)", "Whole Fish"))
plot(fishfactor, pch=15, col=rainbow(4), main="Fish Part Consumption")
```


##Data Wrangling
```{r,eval=FALSE}
setwd('.')

list.files()



```

#Install

```{r}

for (p inpkgs){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    installed.packages(p)
  }
}
  }
}

```

```{r}
#setwd("~/Documents/R/Informatics/env_info_page/students")
#the '../ takes you back one file so to the data file in ev_info_page NOT the one in students
#
d1=read.csv('../data/r-ecology/species.csv')
d1
head(d1)
summary(d1)
class(d1$species_id)
```


##using readr
```{r}
library(readr)

d = read_csv('../data/r-ecology/species.csv')
d
head(d)
summary(d)
class(d$species_id)
# the difference is it loaded as a charater rather than species

```

##dplyr
What year does species 'NL' show up in the surveys.csv
```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

d = read_csv('../data/r-ecology/surveys.csv') %>%
  tbl_df()
# %>% says take this output and use it as input into the next function "piping"

d = read_csv('../data/r-ecology/surveys.csv') %>%
  select(species_id, year) %>%
  #filter(species_id=='NL') %>%
  group_by(species_id,year) %>%
  summarize(count= n())

d
head(d)
summary(d)
glimpse(d)
```
