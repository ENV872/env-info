Repository for practicing doing pull requests. Introduce yourself via a `GITHUB_USERNAME.json` file under [`_data/`](_data/) directory, and submit via pull request. Here's an example:

```javascript
// _data/bbest.json
{
	"program": "lecturer",
	"interests": "marine biology, species distribution modeling, spatial decision-making",
	"project": "route ships around marine mammal hot spots"
}
```

Using the format above, replace with your own `program`, `interests` and `project` idea.
